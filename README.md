## Developer Notes 
jquery was used in Javascript file [script.js] to each hour for User's work schedule and given the ability to add/save or delete task to the app. 
User is able to add task to a time block that will turn GREY once the assigned timeblock has passed into the curent hour, and turn red. Future task will be assigned the color green. 
jQuery creates each timetable div, and allows it to be edited by User.

User is also able to delete a task by clicking on the trashcan icon.

App is customized to suite User's 7AM thru 3PM work schedule, but can be changed for different User requirements.

User is able to save task to there local storage, saving their task if browser is closed.
